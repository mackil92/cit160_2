I think we learned a very powerful tool this week, which is repetition. Although I bet it will take time to get used to them and before they become second nature, it is definitely keep practicing using loops because that is where Computers outshine humans the most! Computers are able to repeat calculations over and over again even a million times and it wonâ€™t make a single mistake.
As long as the programmer designs the program correctly loops can make things go much more efficient.
I learned from the discussion posts this week that there are so many different ways to solve the same problem. Counting odd numbers can be done by finding the module, or just adding 2 starting from 1. It was interesting to see others code that are much simpler and more efficient. I also learned that making the code shorter can result in decrease of readability. Sometimes we can come up with really compact solutions but unless we use good comments to describe how it works it can be difficult for others to understand.
