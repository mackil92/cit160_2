This week was very different from other weeks. I tend to enjoy being in action, writing code and creating programs but as I learn more and more about different programming rules, I found that it becomes more difficult to keep track of how the program is running and what it is exactly doing in each step. Computers are much smarter than humans when it comes to calculating things, and it never makes mistakes. But it is us humans that can design programs and tell the computer what to do. But we make mistakes, sometimes we have design flaws and syntax errors. 
But it is awesome that there are so many tools, especially the development tools in browsers to help us understand what we did wrong. We make mistakes, but we can make computers find those mistakes! It is not all automatic yet, but I think someday debugging might become effortless.
I learned about Javascript strict code from Marjorie and Matts conversation, and thought it was interesting Javascript syntax has a little bit of leeway. Some peopleâ€™s codes still contain things that I have never seen, so I am excited to learn more about them in the future lessons.
