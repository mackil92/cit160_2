Learning from this week’s material was very enjoyable. I had a little experience coding in HTML from previous classes I took at BYU Idaho, but it was refreshing to learn some new tags, such as <canvas> and <textarea>. I am really excited to be able to use JavaScript in my HTML in the near future, since I have learned a lot about CSS, and I am realizing Webpages can do so much more when JavaScript is incorporated compared to styling it by CSS alone. 

On the discussion board, a fellow classmate Matt mentioned about the difference between <textarea> and <input type=”text”>. I was wondering if there was a limit to how many characters each one can hold, or even if the coder could customize the limit. Then I found out on w3schools about the max-length attribute that work for both types. This was very useful information I was able to find for future use!
