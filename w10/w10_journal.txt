I was great to learn how to write multiple functions in the header and practice using and calling functions inside of functions. When I was working on the Robbie the Robot project for this week, I noticed that there is no need to declare parameters in JavaScript functions. In other programming languages the parameter must be declared as a variable first, and then itâ€™s able to be used for functions. I think JavaScript has evolved so much it takes a lot of the tedious work and annoying syntax errors programmers had to face while using other languages, I really love that about JavaScript.  

I really like What Igor did with his input box for this week's assignment. He put a place holder in the input box to help the user know what exactly they should type in. Sometimes we will have to deal with different data types, and it can be hard to assure the right input from the user. I wonder how I can show an error when the wrong data type was entered. I would love to learn how to do that.
