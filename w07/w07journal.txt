My favorite part of this week was learning about Truth tables. I am taking other programming classes as well and using logic operators are an essential part of almost every programming language out there. This class was the only class that touched on how to use truth tables and it has been a great tool for me to check complex logic statements.
The coding assignment from this week was a little more challenging, but it was very useful to know how to get information from the computerâ€™s clock and use it in the program. In the sleep-in programming assignment, I wondered if it was better to try to combine all of the if statements together and make one big logic expression to select the holidays, or if it was better to write separate if statements for each one which would increase readability. I would like to learn more about what guidelines there are on making long logic expressions, because when they are complex, they are very hard to understand at first glance.
Many on the discussion board are posting codes with more HTML content, sometimes even CSS styling. I am inspired to do so for my next assignments
