It was great to get more practice with writing programs with repetitions this week. I learned that for the increment counter use for the For loops can be initialized within the parenthesis instead of being initialized before the loop syntax. I think this makes it a lot more convenient to write code, and make the code cleaner and easier to read, because it will be clear that the variable was declared only for the purpose of counting.
I noticed in the discussion board, there were quite a few minor syntax errors that causes the program to not run. It’s the little mistakes like a missing “ (quotes) or forgetting the ending curly braces. I have definitely had experiences where I misspelt one pf the variables in an equation and taking me a long time to just find that bug. Sometimes it is tempting to say, there is something wrong with the computer, but sadly that is never the case. I found that the editors have great features for example you can highlight a variable and it will highlight all other instances where the variable appears. This really comes in handy when I want to make sure I typed everything correctly.
